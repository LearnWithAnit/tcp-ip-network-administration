### Overview

*Concentrate on what a system administrator really needs to know about TCP/IP administration*

This book addresses the lack of information by providing practical, detailed network information for the UNIX system administrator.

The common thread that ties the enormous Internet together is TCP/IP network software. TCP/IP is a set of communications protocols that define how different types of computers talk to each other. This is a book about building your own network based on TCP/IP. It is both a tutorial covering the "why" and "how" of TCP/IP networking, and a reference manual for the details about specific network programs.
